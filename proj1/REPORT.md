The task of setting up and getting various projects running, proved to be a long, exhausting, challenging, and yet profoundly valuable experience. While working on these projects, we encountered a multitude of difficulties that made our work arduous. In this account, we will delve into the myriad  issues we encountered, ranging from compatibility challenges across software versions to the absence of comprehensive documentation, and outline our proposed strategies to ensure a smoother onboarding process for future users.

A problem  we encountered time and again was compatibility issues stemming from diverse versions of software libraries and frameworks. Especially, certain projects didn’t work with newer Python versions, leading to more tests on older versions to ascertain backward compatibility. One example of this is the "Jobby'' project, which finally worked with Python 3.6.6 after a long series of trials and errors. The Stock Prediction project presented a similar conundrum as we navigated through multiple Python versions without achieving compatibility.

Another challenge revolved around the absence of clearly defined project dependencies. Without a comprehensive list of requirements, we had to undergo a painstaking, long journey through a maze of dependencies, identifying outdated ones, seeking compatible alternatives, and validating their installation's impact on project execution. The Recipe Recommender project, for instance, lacked a requirements.txt file, leaving us to decipher functional prerequisites through extensive trial and error.

Furthermore, we grappled with a lack of detailed project documentation, a deficiency that aggravated our problems. Some projects lacked critical information essential for their successful execution. This issue extended to instructions for setting up the development environment. In the Stock Prediction project, for instance, the readme file offered minimal guidance on executing the project, providing information on dependencies and environment setup that was far from exhaustive. The instructions provided on the project's GitHub repository for project execution proved perplexing and vague, posing a taxing challenge to newcomers. The commands for executing the project didn’t have directory context or explanatory context, leaving users confused. Even setting the Flask environment variable proved to be a daunting task, as the provided command triggered terminal errors, necessitating additional research to identify the correct procedure. These issues collectively hindered our ability to commence work on the project effectively. In the Recipe Recommender project, while commands existed for running the Node.js file, no information was available for establishing a backend connection to MongoDB.

Proposed Best Practices:

After encountering different challenges, we have identified a series of best practices that we intend to adopt, ensuring future users do not encounter the same obstacles:

Versioned Requirements: To streamline the process of running the software, we will document the exact versions of software libraries and frameworks used in the project's requirements file. This proactive approach will eliminate the need for users to grapple with dependency and version compatibility issues, allowing them to save valuable time.

Installation Resources: We will provide direct download links for all necessary software tools and libraries, sparing users the difficult task of wading the internet for installation guides. Additionally, we will provide comprehensive documentation outlining the step-by-step process for configuring the project and environment files on a local machine.

Comprehensive Documentation: Our commitment extends to providing clear and concise documentation on project execution, including instructions on creating a database connection. These efforts will prevent users from becoming mired in the initial setup phase, allowing them to commence their work with ease.

Functional Explanations: To facilitate project comprehension, we will include detailed documentation covering various project functionalities. This reference material will empower users to understand the purpose and operation of specific code segments, fostering a deeper understanding of the project's inner workings.

Video Tutorials: Recognizing diverse learning preferences, we will create informative video content explaining the project's objectives and offering practical demonstrations using test cases. These videos will provide users with a visual and experiential guide, significantly expediting their project implementation.

Function and Method Simplification: In cases where certain functions or methods may pose challenges for newcomers, we will provide clear explanations of their purpose and usage. This additional information will bridge knowledge gaps for users new to specific languages or technologies.

Our journey through the process of setting up various projects served as a valuable lesson in the significance of thorough documentation, clear instructions, and accessibility for users. By implementing these best practices, our aim is to ensure that future users will not be burdened by the same challenges we faced. Our goal is to create a seamless onboarding experience that empowers users to dive into projects with confidence, ultimately leading to more successful and enjoyable project experiences for all.
